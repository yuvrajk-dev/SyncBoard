## 🎯 Project Goal

This project focuses on solving real-world frontend engineering problems:

* Managing shared state across multiple clients
* Handling real-time updates efficiently
* Preventing conflicts with a locking mechanism
* Designing scalable UI architecture

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

* WebSocket communication
* State synchronization
* Event-driven architecture
* Coordinate-based UI systems
* Performance optimization (throttling, rendering)

---

## 📌 Current Status

* [x] Project initialized
* [ ] Cursor tracking (in progress)
* [ ] Multi-user sync
* [ ] Draggable notes
* [ ] Locking system
* [ ] Zoom & pan

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add user identity (name + color)
* Persist board state (database)
* Add authentication
* Improve performance for large boards

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Inspired by collaborative tools like Figma and modern collaborative whiteboards.
